To get these figures to work right with the LaTeX files when using
Xfig Version 3.2:

After saving the file, it must be exported. Use the entry
"Combined PS/LaTeX (both parts)". This will create the files (for
figure foo.fig) foo.pstex and foo.pstex_t. Unfortunately, there are
two problems with this process.

1) I used the epsfig package. Under Xfig 3.2, it outputs at the 2nd
line something like
\includegraphics{foo.pstex}

What I need is
\epsfig{foo.pstex}

I'm not sure what the proper package is to use \includegraphics.

The second problem is that the LaTeX code gets sucked into the LaTeX
files, but they have to reference this current figure directory. So
what the 2nd line actually has to say is:

\epsfig{../figs/foo.pstex}

There are two ways to do this. Either hand-edit the .pstex_t file (to
solve both the \epsfig problem and the directory referencing problem)
or, when you export the file, change the name of the file to be
../figs/foo.pstex in the "output file" box. This puts it in exactly
the same place as it would have gone, except now it will put into the
.pstex_t file "../figs/foo.pstex" instead of just "foo.pstex".


TODO: Document how to package the figure up as a .gif file for
exporting to, say, Powerpoint.
