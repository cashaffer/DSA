// This is the file to include in your code if you want access to the
// complete LList template class

// First, get the declaration for the base list class
#include "list.h"

// This is the declaration for LList. It is split into two parts
// because it is too big to fit on one book page
#include "LList1.book"
#include "LList2.book"
